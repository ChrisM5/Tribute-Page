                <p>Born in Thal, Austria on July 30, 1947. He grew up poor, noting how the day they got a refridgerator was a highlight of his youth. But even growing up like he did, he was always known for having a positive and hopeful outlook that has got him so far today. Arnold grew up playing sports, and started going after weightlifting as early as 14, and started his competitive career at the age of 17. He often went to the movie theater to see bodybuilding idols and get the hope that he too could attain that dream, and so he did. He came to America in 1968, after winning many bodybuilding competitions over in Europe and even Mexico. Started a brick laying company with fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu that they later turned into mail-order business where they sold bodybuilding and other fitness related products. </p>

                <p>In 1970, Arnold won the most prestigious award in bodybuilding, the Mr. Olympia. Also being the youngest to ever win 1st place. He went on to win it again the following 5 years and once again in 1980. Arnold was the star of a documentary called <a class="a" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pumping-Iron-Arnold-Schwarzenegger/dp/B00PGWI6QC" target="_blank">Pumping Iron</a> that debuted in 1977. This movie is why most bodybuilders around the world will say it is what inspired them into the competitions, as a hobby or a career. So much so that in 1989, the <a class="a" href="https://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/" target="_blank">Arnold Sports Festival</a> was created. This event, is held annually in Columbus, OH. Though now held worldwide as well, it has become one of the most prestigiuos events for all physique type competitors, second only to the Olympia. The event is now home to many competitions, such as Strongman and Powerlifting.</p>

                    Arnold started his acting career the same year that he won the Mr. Olympia. His accent in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_in_New_York" target="_blank"><i>Hercules in New York</i></a> was so thick, that he was dubbed over in the final version. His perseverance wouldn't let him down though. After being told that his accent is too strong, body to "strange" for the big screen, he still managed to keep getting roles, Golden Globe for New Star of the Year in 1976 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_Hungry" target="_blank"><i>Stay Hungry</i></a>. In 1982, he starred in his first breakthrough, action movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian_(1982_film)" target="_blank"><i>Conan the Barbarian</i></a>. His career soon launched off after this movie. Getting roles in many, many classics, true to the test of time. <i>Terminator series, Total Recall, Last Action Hero, Predator, Twins.</i> The list can go on and on.
